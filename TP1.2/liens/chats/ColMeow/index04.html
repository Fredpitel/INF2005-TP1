		<p class="description">
			Guinness World Records, the global authority on record-breaking achievement, 
			today revealed its latest record-breaker: Colonel Meow, the Cat 
			with the longest fur.
			<br>
			Colonel Meow, who was adopted as a rescue cat from the Himalayan & Persian 
			Society, needs his fur brushed 2–3 times a week, and it takes both Anne and 
			Eric to complete the job. 
		</p>
		<p class="description">
			Guinness World Records Editor-in-Chief, Craig Glenday, said: “Colonel Meow 
			is being groomed for stardom, and I know the furry feline will be a big hit 
			with readers. He’s an incredible creature, and he’ll undoubtedly inspire people 
			all around to the world to whip out their rulers and start measuring their own 
			cat’s fur.
		</p>
		<p class="description">
			The Himalayan-Persian cross-breed has fur that reaches 22.87cm (9in) and features 
			in the new Guinness World Records 2014 book out on September 12.
